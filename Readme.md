## Introduction to our solution

Our project is revolving around music.\
Our vision was to create an application which can show a variety of lists and features, of all the popular songs from Spotify, based on their 
Top 200 lists from the last 10 years - along with a set of different features.

The data we use is collected from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhruvildave/spotify-charts), where they have a very large dataset, with approximately 21 mio songs.

These features include:
- Audio Features (Taken from the spotify api) -> [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/)
- Lyrics (Scrapped from Genius.com) -> [Lyrics](https://www.genius.com)
- Collaborators (Also scrapped from Genius.com) -> [Collaborators](https://www.genius.com)

The data we use in the application is cleaned from different unused values, which includes:
- Duplicates (We just show the highest rank of a given song)
- Other values we didn't know what to use for

We store the different information from the songs in different databases, to show our ability to use them, 
and make them work together in a single frontend application.

Our Application is built of Micro Services, which is set up to be registered with a Eureka Server.\
Through the Eureka Server, our API Gateway stores the information about the different endpoints of the Micro Services - and our frontend application uses the API Gateway to serve the data in a single web application.

### Static Architecture diagram

The following image presents a Static Architecture Diagram of our application.\
The diagram below shows the connection between our services, and how they are managed through the Eureka Server.
It also serves as an overview of the different Micro Services, and which databases we use for the different Services/Applications.

### Kafka

We are using Kafka for delivering messages to our Logger Service, in order to gather different data for the
administrators of the website.

The reason we use Kafka, is to eliminate any dependency the different Micro Services would have of each other - 
if we for example stored the data directly into a database, from each Micro Service.

Kafka eliminates these dependencies, because each Micro Service deliver messages through a Kafka Server. If a Service breaks down, it just won't deliver messages - but the rest of the services will still work normally.

The messages to Kafka includes:
- Creation of new users and music entries.
- Login
- Session data about time spend and number of endpoints viewed.
- And more..

Below is an overview of how Kafka handles the different messages between our Micro Services.

## Micro Services

- Below we list the different Micro Services we are using, and a brief explanation of their responsibilities.

#### DSDB-Users
- This service is handling all transaction regarding users and makes sure the users' login credentials are correct in terms of password and username. 

#### DSDB-Music
- The DSDB-Music service is managing all calls to the MongoDB regarding the Track and artists related to the specific song.

#### DSDB-AudioFeatures
- Here we are managing all transactions happening to and from the MySql database which contains all the Audio features.

#### DSDB-Lyrics
- As the name implies, the DSDB-Lyric is responsible for handling the transactions we are running to get the lyrics of the songs.

#### DSDB-Collaborators
- This microservice is making sure we can deliver the collaborators on the individual tracks for the songs we are presenting through our other microservices.

#### DSDB-Logger
- In DSDB-Logger, we are managing the log files which can be presented to the administrators if requested. 

#### DSDB-Gateway
- This is more or less an empty shell which works as a middle man between our Eurika server, and our client application. 

#### DSDB-FrontEnd
- DSDB_FrontEnd has the responsibility of presenting the graphical user interface to the guest, user or administrator using our program.

#### DSDB-EurekaServer

Netflix Eureka is our application that holds the information about all client-server applications.
All the microservices in this application are registered into our Eureka server and then our Eureka server knows which port our individual service is running on - this means that we can easily create and annotate a API Gateway, which then has access to all the different Micro Services' endpoints.

![](images/Eureka-Overview.png)

As shown above, we can access this information from our Eureka server, by going to our browser http://localhost:8761/ where we can get an overview of all the servers running, the names and on what port these services are running.
***
###BCrypt

Bcrypt is a password-hashing function based on the blowfish algorithm.

We are using this library to secure the passwords of our users, by making a one way hashing on the passwords.\
This means that when a user is creating a password, it will be hashed - and can never be 'unhashed' again.\
By this way, we ensure that all users passwords remain a secret.

## Use Cases

## Database queries


### MongoDB

### Neo4j
When we look at our neo4j graph, we are interested in seeing who is working with whom, and what people are collaborating a lot.
First we are going to create our projection.

    CALL gds.graph.project.cypher(
        'artists',
        'MATCH (p:Person) RETURN id(p) AS 'id',
        'MATCH (p:Person)-[r:COLABORATED]->(m:Person) RETURN id(n) AS source, id(m) AS target')
    YIELD
        graphName AS graph, nodeQuery, nodeCount AS nodes, relationshipQuery, relationshipCount AS rels
This query will create our graph projection. and via the YIELD command return the following:
![img.png](images/Create_graph_projection.png)
 
We can also check all of our graph projections by using:

    CALL gds.graph.list()

After we've created our projection, we can take a look closer to our data in our database.

    CALL gds.degree.stream('artists')
    YIELD nodeId, score
    RETURN gds.util.asNode(nodeID).name AS name, score AS collaborators
    ORDER BY collaborators DESC, name DESC
This tells us who has been collaborator with most different people
![img.png](images/Collaborated%20_out.png)

We can also see who is a popular person for others to collaborate with

    CALL gds.degree.stream(
        'artists',
        {orientation: 'REVERSE' }
    )
    YIELD nodeID, score
    RETURN gds.util.asNode(nodeId).name AS name, score AS collaborators
    ORDER BY collaborators DESC, name DESC

![img.png](images/collaborators_in.png)

We can see that "Drake" do almost have an equal amount of in and uot collaborators. The same is the case with "Young Thug",
but the placement on the list is different.

The following picture is showing the above two queries in a graph visualization:\
![img.png](images/collaborators_graph.png)

As can be seen "Young Thug" has 6 other artists who have collaborated with him, where "Young Thug" has collaborated with 5 other artist.


### Redis

### PostgreSQL
